This is the Branch used for the Api|Backend files based on PHP 8.2. for the Budgetmanager project.

Notes:
  -No framework such as Laravel or Symfony was used, this choice was made in order to get more familiar with OOP and PHP as it is.
  -The architecture MVC is used
  -Everything such as Model, Controllers, Response, Translations and other Classes were written entirely by me.
